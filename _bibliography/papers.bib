  abstract={Studies on the characterization of the dexterity of
fingers and hands improve the understanding of how humans
interact with computing devices. In this study, finger bending
patterns captured by flex sensors worn on the fingers are
characterized to build a biometric authentication system. The
modality uses an array of resistive sensors fitted in a smart glove
worn by users while typing. The study encompasses 55 users,
23 of them entered a 9-digit PIN on a laptop’s number pad,
and 32 of them typed a 10-length alphanumeric password on the
full-sized keyboard. The results demonstrate that the users are
authenticated using features built from the flex sensors relating
to their PIN and password with a mean EER score of 7.49% and
9.76%, respectively. We further assessed the potential of using
individual fingers to authenticate users in both the biometric
systems and found that even the fingers not used for typing ex-
hibited discriminative patterns due to movement dynamics during
the typing process. This assessment highlights the potential for
designing lightweight biometric modalities utilizing dexterity and
patterns based on fewer fingers.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of smartphone usage has sparked
a proliferation of public phone-charging hubs to cater to
peoples’ growing charging needs. By virtue of being located
in public spaces, however, these hubs have the potential to
be manipulated by malicious actors who seek to use them as
a vehicle to launch cyberattacks against the users of these
hubs. In this paper, we show that if such a public charging
hub is rigged with a power measurement circuitry, the power
measurements could enable the inference of videos watched
by the user on the phone. Using a playlist of 100 YouTube
music videos, we show this kind of attack to classify the videos
with an accuracy of up to 94.49%. We rigorously examine
the dynamics of the attack using 5 different phone models,
16 screen brightness and volume configurations, and various
training configurations and show it to be highly effective
under a wide range of settings. Depending on the content of
such videos, the profile of the target, and the attacker’s aims
(e.g., government vs. private hacker), we argue that such an
attack could have far-reaching privacy implications. The paper
adds to the body of work highlighting power side-channels on
computing devices as a potent threat to user privacy.},

  abstract={Games are designed to build on certain inherently reward centered
aspects of our psychology. This encourages the user to keep
playing and engaging in the entertainment for just a bit longer. In
this paper we explore the way in which gamification can be used
to benefit researchers aiming to collect large amounts of data from
sometimes less than enthusiastically motivated participants.
We also investigate the risks associated with such mechanisms for
data collection and how malicious entities could use these same
methods to trick users into exposing private information. Across
several experiments used to measure the cross-applicable nature
of the data we collected, we demonstrate that a gamified version
of a data collection tool could be used to predict the pattern used
to unlock a phone.},
