Welcome to (Sraddhanjali) Acharya (श्रद्धाञ्जली आचार्य in Nepali) page. 

She is a biometrics researcher turned entrepreneur with a PhD in computer science. She is interested in biometrics, security, privacy, side-channel analysis and machine learning. 

She defended my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Texas Tech University advised by [Dr. Abdul Serwadda](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/abdul_serwadda/index.php). She has designed wearable systems that become smarter through machine learning enhancing security, enabling authentication, and uncovering hidden privacy risks. 

At Qualcomm, she scaled that expertise to the hardware level, leveraging large-scale anomaly analytics and refactoring pipelines to save up to 50% in cloud resources.

Today, she blends her foundation in information system design, biometrics, machine learning, LLMOps, and AWS to help people and companies build secure, efficient, and scalable products from research prototypes.

<ul> Check out some of her work </ul>
1. Biometrics for wearables (biometrics, wearables, machine learning) {% include _projects/1_project.md %}
2. grAInny bot for content moderation for Farcaster (web3 mini-app)
3. Fitness app (iOS, World, web3 mini-app)
4. Psychic pomodoro (iOS, LLMOps)
5. Hospital scheduling (web, LLMOps, AI assisted scheduling)
