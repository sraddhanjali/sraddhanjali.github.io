Welcome to Sraddhanjali Acharya's  (श्रद्धाञ्जली आचार्य in Nepali) page. 

She is a biometrics researcher turned entrepreneur with a PhD in computer science. She is interested in biometrics, security, privacy, side-channel analysis and machine learning. 

She defended her Ph.D. in Computer Science from Texas Tech University advised by [Dr. Abdul Serwadda](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/abdul_serwadda/index.php). She has designed wearable systems that become smarter through machine learning enhancing security through authentication mechanisms and uncovering privacy risks. 

At Qualcomm, she scaled that expertise to the hardware level, leveraging large-scale anomaly analytics and refactoring pipelines to save up to 50% in cloud resources (cpu time).

Today, she blends her foundation in information system design, biometrics, machine learning, LLMOps, and AWS to help people and companies build secure, efficient, and scalable products from research prototypes.
